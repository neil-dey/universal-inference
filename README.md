This repository contains the source code for the simulations and experiments in our paper "Anytime-Valid Generalized Universal Inference on Risk Minimizers."

Before journal revisions (i.e, prior to commit cfdac54), code was run using:

    Python v3.8.10
    Numpy v1.23.3
    Scipy v1.9.1

After journal revisions, code was run using:

    Python v3.10.15
    Numpy v1.26.4
    Scipy v1.13.1

The file workflow.sh contains the code necessary to replicate all simulations and experiments in the order presented in the paper.
