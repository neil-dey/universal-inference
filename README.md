This repository contains the source code for the simulations and experiments in our paper "Anytime-Valid Generalized Universal Inference on Risk Minimizers."

Code was run using:

    Python v3.8.10
    Numpy v1.23.3
    Scipy v1.9.1

The file workflow.sh contains the code necessary to replicate all simulations and experiments in the order presented in the paper.
